	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
	Cardio-Vascular diseases are the first cause of death worldwide, the World Health Organisation estimates
	that they are responsible for about 31% of all global deaths. However, upon preprocessing and data exploration, they seem
	to only make up 13% of the WHO dataset that we have. It is hard to know why that is for now but we will keep this fact in
	mind when creating our visualizations so as to not provide incomplete insights. Using our visualizations we’d like to raise
	awareness towards those diseases. Indeed, we often don’t realize how frequent and diverse the symptoms can be.
	</p>
	<p>
	We are addressing ourselves to everybody as anybody can be or has a relative that might be more subject to a
	cardiovascular disease. More awareness on these diseases and common symptoms can help young people be more cautious of their
	health meanwhile providing at risk people with partial answers and solutions on some conditions they might start to notice.

	<h3>Individual aggravating factors</h3>
	<p>
	We want to explore what in your personal way of life, can prevent or on the contrary increase the probability of developping a cardiovascular disease.
	</p>
	<h4>How to use</h4>
	<p>
		For this first visualization, you can hover over a link to make it light up along with all it's resulting link up to the CVD column.
		By cliking on a link, the total number of records that corresponds to it appear, along with the percentage it represents with respect
		with the total number ofr record in the dataset. As people can cumulate multiple factors on the left of the graph, the percentages don't sum up to 100%
		across factors. Instead, the number on one link represents the total number and proportion of subjects that had the exact combinations of factor-age-CVD.
		You can easily disable a node by clicking on it, making all the links connected to it dissapear. Finally, you can also rearrange the nodes
		on their y-axis by drag-and-dropping them where you want on their column.

	</figure>
</div>

<div class="width-limited_2">
	<p>
	In this first visualization we wanted to understand how our lifestyle and health migh influence our risks of having a
	cardiovascular disease. The nodes different factors and their "opposite" on the right have sizes proportional to their
	representation in our dataset. We can see for example, that there were very few alcohol consumers compared to the ones not
	consuming alcohol. We can also see that most our records concerned people between 50 ans 59 years old, and that the cases of
	cardiovascular diseases were fairly equally distributed.
</p>
<p>
	Important to notice that the sizes of the factors are relative to their opposite: so the sum of records accros 2 opposites
	(under weight/not under weight) is the total number of records.
</p>
<p>
	From the graph, we can see that while some factors seem to disperse more into the CVD node for younger age ranges, it does not apply for older subjects. For example, we have almost 10’000 records of active subjects between in their fourties that did not have CVD, in opposition to 5928 that had CVD, but for subjects older than 60 years old, the poportions are reversed: 6870 of avtice subjects had CVD whereas 3518 didn’t.  This schema seems to be the case across almost all factors whihc would signify that age plays a major role in the risk of having CVD.

	<h3>Influence of the living place on the apparition of cardiovascular diseases</h3>
	<p>
		Here we want study the evolution of the proportion of cardiovascular related deaths over all deaths worldwide.
		Through this visualization we want to see whether the proportion of cardiovascular related deaths changes depending on the part of the world people live in.
		We also want to see if this tendency is true over several years and if in general, the number of cardiovascular realted deaths had increases or decreased over the past
		30 years. This visualization will thus us understand the impact of our environment on the development of such diseases. The user however has to keep in mind
		that the data recovered from the World Health Organisation is highly dependent on the cooperation of the different states. Indeed
		as one will notice some countries give data almost every year when others fail to provide consistent data.
	</p>
	<h4>How to use</h4>
	<p>
	Select the desired year with the slider and go over any country you wish to have more information about.
	It will display the exact percentage of deaths related to cardiovascular diseases for that specific year in the selected country.

		Although some countries are missing, this visualization highlights an overall high proportion of deaths from cardiovascular
		diseases in all Eastern Europe. Indeed Bulgaria for example has around 30% of its deaths related to cardiovascular diseases
		 for all the years in which WHO has collected data. On the contrary South America and Thailand both have less than 10%
		 deaths related to cardiovascular diseases on all the years recorded. As for the states like the United states, France and
		  Brasil , the percentage seems rather constant over the past 30 years. We can see that CVDs are more deadly in Eastern
			Europe as well as some countries of the Middle East than in the rest of the world where the rates are quite similar.

	<h4>How to use</h4>
	<p>
	To use this visualization you first need to select one factor in the drop down list. The visualization will then display the
	total number of cardio deaths by year. You can zoom on a spot by selecting it using a square. If you want to check the ratio
	of cardio deaths for 1000 deaths in this category just click on the button. If you want to go back to the previous
	visualization click on the button total number of cardio deaths.

			From this visualization, we can see that the number of cardio deaths in each continent remains quite constant. When plotting
			by 1000 ratio, we can see that the number of cardio deaths for 1000 has augmented in the 5 years in Africa while it remains
			quite constant in the other countries.
			</p>
			<p>
Considering the sex, we see that the total number of deaths remains also quite constant and equal for each sex. The rise and
the decrease at the beginning and the end of the plot are due to the missing values. However when plotting the ratio we can see
a big increase in the ratio of cardio deaths for females the latest years.
			</p>
			<p>
Finally when using ages, we can see that people over their sixties are largely responsible for the number of cardio deaths in
the last years and that it remains quite constant throughout the last 30 years.
When plotting the ratio, we see that when considering the age, the ratio stays quite constant as well and didn’t evolve much
during the last three decades.

In conclusion from, this visualization we observed that the number of cardio deaths remained quite constant in the last 30 years and that thus time doesn’t seem to affect your risk of dying from a CVD. The only difference observed was for females in the last years, where the ratio of cardio deaths augmented drastically as well as for Africa.

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
	With these visualizations, we were able to see that the time factor (having a CVD in 1988 or in 2019) didn't affect
	much your risk of dying from a CVD even though there were a raise in the last years of the CVD induced deaths in Africa
	and for females.
	</p>
	<p>
	We also observed that CVD seem to be way more deadly in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East whereas in the rest of
	the world the rates are closer with some countries being far less affected by CVD deaths (e.g. South Africa).
