	<h4>First Dataset</h4>
	<p>
	The first dataset collects 70’000 records of patients with 11 features and one target, the target being whether the patient
	has a cardio-vascular disease. The features are age, sex, height, weight, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,
	cholesterol, glucose, whether the patient smokes, drinks, alcohol, and his physical activity. The dataset values were
	collected at the medical examination of the patients. As ages were given in days, we had to convert the ages in years for
	bettering understanding. After some pre-processing, we observed that most of the records concerned people older than 39 years
	old with only 4 records of younger people. Hence, when using this dataset we will focus on people older than 39. Of those
	records, about half (34’979 records) are people suffering from a cardio-vascular disease.

	<h4>Second Dataset</h4>
	<p>
		The second dataset is a compilation of mortality data from the World Health Organization. It collects data reported annually
		 by the civil registrations of the member states, it only registers deaths that are medically-certified meaning that
		 diagnosis by lay people are not included. It contains 792’103’115 records of death of which 103’526’649 are due to
		 cardiovascular disease so about 13% of all deaths. This dataset records the sex, the country, the year, the cause, and the
		 age of death. It has records from 1988 to 2019. For processing this dataset, two additional datasets were needed : the first
		 one being the country name associated with its code and the second associating the cause of death to its code. We will need
		 to see if each year and each country has enough records. Some countries are missing as they do not report to WHO and the
		 latest years of some countries are also missing as WHO takes at least a year to proof-check the data submitted. As there
		 was a lot of data, we had to manually merge five .csv files containing the mortality records of the tenth revision of ICD
		 (classification of diseases, the tenth being the most recent one).
